{"explanation": "The query aims to retrieve the top 10 movies with the highest number of screenings. \n\n1. `SELECT p.ten_phim, COUNT(lc.ma_lich_chieu) AS so_lan_chieu`:\n This part specifies the columns to be returned:\n   - `p.ten_phim`: The title of the movie (from the `phim` table, aliased as `p`).\n   - `COUNT(lc.ma_lich_chieu) AS so_lan_chieu`: The count of screenings for each movie. `COUNT()` function counts the occurrences of `ma_lich_chieu` (screening ID) in the `lich_chieu` table (aliased as `lc`). The result is aliased as `so_lan_chieu` (number of screenings).\n2. `FROM phim p JOIN lich_chieu lc ON p.ma_phim = lc.ma_phim`:\n This section joins the `phim` and `lich_chieu` tables based on the common column `ma_phim` (movie ID).  This combines information about movies and their corresponding screenings.\n3. `GROUP BY p.ma_phim`:\n The data is grouped by `ma_phim`, meaning the `COUNT()` function will calculate the total screenings for each unique movie.\n4. `ORDER BY so_lan_chieu DESC`:\n The results are sorted in descending order based on the `so_lan_chieu` (number of screenings), so the movies with the most screenings appear first.\n5. `LIMIT 10`:\n The query returns only the top 10 movies with the highest screening counts.\n\nOptimization Suggestions:\n- **Index:** Create an index on the `ma_phim` column in both the `phim` and `lich_chieu` tables. This will significantly improve the performance of the `JOIN` operation.\n- **Explain Plan:** Use an `EXPLAIN` plan to analyze the query execution plan. This can help identify potential bottlenecks and areas for further optimization.\n- **Query Rewriting:** Depending on the database system, it might be possible to rewrite the query using a different approach that's more efficient.", "suggestion": "Create an index on the `ma_phim` column in both the `phim` and `lich_chieu` tables, use an `EXPLAIN` plan to analyze the query execution plan, and consider rewriting the query for potential efficiency improvements.", "problems": "If the `lich_chieu` table is very large, the query could be slow due to the `COUNT()` operation."}
