The SQL query aims to retrieve the names of movies (ten_phim) and their average ticket prices (gia_ve) from a database containing information about movies (`phim` table) and movie showtimes (`lich_chieu` table).  Let's break down how it works step by step:

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT p.ten_phim, AVG(l.gia_ve) AS average_ticket_price`**: This part specifies the columns to be retrieved in the result set. 
    - `p.ten_phim`: Selects the movie name from the `phim` table (aliased as `p`).
    - `AVG(l.gia_ve)`: Calculates the average ticket price for each movie. It takes the `gia_ve` column from the `lich_chieu` table (aliased as `l`) and applies the `AVG` aggregate function to it. The result is aliased as `average_ticket_price`.

2. **`FROM phim p JOIN lich_chieu l ON p.ma_phim = l.ma_phim`**: This defines the tables involved and how they are related.
    - `FROM phim p`:  Indicates that the `phim` table is the primary table in the query. It's aliased as `p` for brevity.
    - `JOIN lich_chieu l`: Joins the `lich_chieu` table to the `phim` table. The `lich_chieu` table is aliased as `l`.
    - `ON p.ma_phim = l.ma_phim`: Specifies the join condition. It connects rows from the two tables where the `ma_phim` (movie ID) column in both tables matches.

3. **`GROUP BY p.ten_phim, p.the_loai`**: Groups the results based on unique combinations of movie names and genres. This is essential because we want to calculate the average ticket price for each distinct movie.

4. **`LIMIT 20`**: Restricts the number of returned rows to 20.

**Suggestion:**

- **Index:** Create an index on the `ma_phim` column in both the `phim` and `lich_chieu` tables. This will significantly speed up the join operation, as the database can quickly find matching rows based on the indexed column.
