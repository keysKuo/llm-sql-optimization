**SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT p.ma_phim AS 'Movie ID',
       p.ten_phim AS 'Movie Name',
       pc.ten_phong AS 'Theater Name',
       lc.ngay_chieu AS 'Release Date'
FROM phim AS p
JOIN lich_chieu AS lc ON p.ma_phim = lc.ma_phim
JOIN phong_chieu AS pc ON lc.ma_phong = pc.ma_phong
LIMIT 20;
```
**Explanation:**
This query retrieves the Movie ID, Movie Name, Theater Name, and Release Date from the `phim`, `lich_chieu`, and `phong_chieu` tables, respectively. It joins these tables based on their relations: movies have multiple screenings (in `lich_chieu`) which in turn are associated with specific theaters (in `phong_chieu`). Finally, it limits the results to 20 rows using the LIMIT keyword.

**Suggestion:**
To optimize this query, you could create indexes on columns used for joining or filtering, like `ma_phim` in `lich_chieu` and `ma_phong` in `phong_chieu`. This helps the database engine to quickly locate matching rows during a join operation.

**Problems:**
If there are too many records in these tables, this query may take a long time to execute due to the volume of data being processed. Also, if there is no index on the columns used for joining or filtering, the query could be slow as the database engine needs to scan through the entire table to find matching rows. In such cases, creating indexes would help to speed up the query execution.
