**SQL Query:**
                ```sql
                SELECT
                    dt.ngay,
                    SUM(dt.tong_doanh_thu) AS tong_doanh_thu
                FROM
                    doanh_thu_ngay dt
                GROUP BY
                    dt.ngay
                LIMIT 20;  
                ```

                **Explanation:** 
                This SQL query calculates the total revenue for each day from a table named 'doanh_thu_ngay' (likely meaning 'daily revenue').

                1. **`SELECT dt.ngay, SUM(dt.tong_doanh_thu) AS tong_doanh_thu`**: This part specifies the columns to be retrieved:
                   - `dt.ngay`:  The 'ngay' column from the 'doanh_thu_ngay' table, which presumably stores the date.
                   - `SUM(dt.tong_doanh_thu)`: This calculates the sum of the 'tong_doanh_thu' (total revenue) column for each distinct date.  The result is aliased as 'tong_doanh_thu'.

                2. **`FROM doanh_thu_ngay dt`**: This indicates the table from which the data is being retrieved: 'doanh_thu_ngay', aliased as 'dt' for brevity.

                3. **`GROUP BY dt.ngay`**: This clause groups the rows in the 'doanh_thu_ngay' table by the 'ngay' column. This means the `SUM` function will be applied to aggregate revenue for each unique date.

                4. **`LIMIT 20`**: This clause limits the number of rows returned by the query to the first 20 rows.

                **Suggestion:** 
                - **Index on 'ngay' column:** Creating an index on the 'ngay' column in the 'doanh_thu_ngay' table will significantly improve the performance of this query, especially if you frequently query by date.

                **Problems:** 
                - **Potential Performance Bottleneck:**  
                   - If the 'doanh_thu_ngay' table is large, this query could potentially be slow, especially without an index on the 'ngay' column. The database will have to scan the entire table to group and sum the revenues.
                - **Limited Scope:** The `LIMIT 20` clause restricts the results to only the first 20 days. If you need to analyze revenue for a wider range of dates, you'll need to adjust this limit.
